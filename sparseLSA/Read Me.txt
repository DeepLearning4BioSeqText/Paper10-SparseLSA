Please run sparse_drive.m to test the demo of sparse LSA. 

The main function to test algorithm: sparse_LSA.m 

A_learning.m: learning sparse A matrix in Sparse LSA

A_learning_nn.m: learning nonnegative sparse A matrix in sparse LSA (set by nn_tag)

A_learning_group.m: learning sparse A matrix with group structure
(set by group_tag)

PROPACK is a fast implementation for SVD. If it does not work properly, one needs to mex the 
files in PORPACK on his/her own machine. One should check the conditions of PROPACK
(http://soi.stanford.edu/~rmunk/PROPACK/) for using or redistribution of it.

The toy data 20ng_data is 20 news-group with the class 1 and 20 using tf-idf features.
